"""Veyra Core: Transaction State & Execution Boundary Safety (Phase 60 Specification).

Models transaction execution states:
- PRE: Before tool execution begins
- IN_FLIGHT: Action dispatched to network/environment
- PARTIAL: Tool performed partial mutation before connection died or timed out
- COMMITTED: Action successfully committed to environment
- UNKNOWN_ACK: Connection dropped after commit or timeout before ACK received
- VERIFIED: External oracle or idempotent status check verified actual state
- FAILED: Execution failed with no mutations committed

Allowed Recovery Actions:
- VERIFY: Read-only check against state oracle or verification tool
- IDEMPOTENCY_REPLAY: Safe replay using client idempotency key
- COMPENSATE: Explicit rollback / compensation transaction
- DEFER: Hold execution for external confirmation
- ASK: Escalate to human user
