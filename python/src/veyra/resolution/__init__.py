"""Veyra Resolution Layer.

Formal execution resolution pipeline conforming to Sections 2 and 3:
- Candidate Generation
- Hard Constraint Filtering (authorization, tenant, capability, contract, side-effect safety, transaction invariants)
- Policy Resolution
- State / Health / Freshness Checks
- Preference Ranking
- Deterministic Resolvers (StaticPriority, HealthAware, FreshnessAware, PolicyAware, VeyraResolver)
- Formal 15-class Failure Taxonomy
