"""Failure-directed harness.

Native reruns the broken command. The graph harness can rewrite the file, and
it charges graph overhead on every step of every task. Repair sits between
them: before the model acts, it loads the workspace files that the failure
points at, and its scripted policy edits before it executes.

The diagnosis is an observation, not a new action. The kernel still chooses
whether this harness runs at all.
