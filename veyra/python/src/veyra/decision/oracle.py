"""Offline oracle arm: an upper bound on the value of switching.

The oracle is *not* deployable and is never run online in the paper's sense. It
is given the realized outcome of every fixed-harness run for the same task and
may switch at a checkpoint to whichever harness actually did better.

It answers one question:

    If the runtime had known in advance which harness wins here,
    how much would switching have been worth?

That turns "adaptive routing helped" into a measurable gap between the adaptive
policy and an achievable ceiling.
